# RainFree-Net: Image-Deraining
Rain-Free-Net is a deep learning-based image deraining model designed to remove rain streaks from images, improving visibility and clarity. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and achieves excellent results in real-time applications like autonomous driving and surveillance.

# Before Deraining the input image is:

## Project Structure
- **Train_Dataset**: Contains **heavy rain images** used for training the model.
- **Test_Dataset**: Contains **test images** used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
- **Val Datset**:Contains **validation images** used during training to tune the model.
- **Code**: Contains scripts for **training**, **testing**, and **evaluating** the model's performance.
